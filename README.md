This calculator allows a user to create a mortgage repayment schedule. It is based on the Amount, Tenure, and Rate, which can be manipulated and changed to produce payment projections. This allows the user to make adjustments to determine a suitable repayment plan for their individual needs.

A chart component was also added to the project.
